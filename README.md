# üï∫ ppap

[PPAP](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAP_(%E3%82%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AA%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3)) is send a zip file with `P`assword by email, send a `P`assword by email, `A`ngouka (encryption) and `P`rotocol acronym for this.
It's a silly practice, but one that often needs to be followed.
I sincerely hope that this practice will disappear soon.

Targeted at Mac users.

## üöÄ Features

- Compresses the specified file or folder and sets the password
- The password will be read from `$HOME/.ppaprc`
- If `$HOME/.ppaprc` is not found, the password will be generated automatically
- ZIP file entries should be encoded in Shift_JIS, because most recipients are Japanese Windows users
